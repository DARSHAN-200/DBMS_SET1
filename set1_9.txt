9. Create the following tables. And Solve following queries by SQL 
•  Deposit (actno,cname,bname,amount,adate) 
• Branch (bname,city) 
• Customers (cname, city) 
• Borrow(loanno,cname,bname, amount) 
Add primary key and foreign key wherever applicable. 
Insert data into the above created tables. 
1. Display names of depositors having amount greater than 4000. 
2. Display account date of customers Anil  
3. Display account no. and deposit amount of customers having account opened 
between dates 1-12-96 and 1-5-97 
4. Find the average account balance at the Perryridge branch. 
5. Find the names of all branches where the average account balance is more 
than $1,200. 
6. Delete depositors having deposit less than 5000 
7. Create a view on deposit table.



Step 1: Creating the Tables and Adding Primary and Foreign Keys-- Creating Branch Table

CREATE TABLE Branch (
    bname VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Creating Customers Table
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    cname VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Creating Deposit Table with Foreign Key References
CREATE TABLE Deposit (
    actno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    cname VARCHAR(50),
    bname VARCHAR(50),
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    adate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (cname) REFERENCES Customers(cname),
    FOREIGN KEY (bname) REFERENCES Branch(bname)
);

-- Creating Borrow Table with Foreign Key References
CREATE TABLE Borrow (
    loanno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    cname VARCHAR(50),
    bname VARCHAR(50),
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (cname) REFERENCES Customers(cname),
    FOREIGN KEY (bname) REFERENCES Branch(bname)
);

Step 2: Inserting Sample Data

-- Inserting Data into Branch Table
INSERT INTO Branch (bname, city) VALUES
('Perryridge', 'New York'),
('Downtown', 'Los Angeles');

-- Inserting Data into Customers Table
INSERT INTO Customers (cname, city) VALUES
('Anil', 'New York'),
('John', 'Los Angeles'),
('Alice', 'New York');

-- Inserting Data into Deposit Table
INSERT INTO Deposit (actno, cname, bname, amount, adate) VALUES
(101, 'Anil', 'Perryridge', 5000, '1996-12-15'),
(102, 'John', 'Downtown', 3000, '1997-04-01'),
(103, 'Alice', 'Perryridge', 6000, '1997-01-10');

-- Inserting Data into Borrow Table
INSERT INTO Borrow (loanno, cname, bname, amount) VALUES
(201, 'Anil', 'Perryridge', 2000),
(202, 'John', 'Downtown', 4000),
(203, 'Alice', 'Perryridge', 7000);

Step 3: Queries

Query 1: Display names of depositors having amount greater than 4000.

SELECT cname 
FROM Deposit 
WHERE amount > 4000;

Query 2: Display account date of customer Anil.

SELECT adate 
FROM Deposit 
WHERE cname = 'Anil';

Query 3: Display account number and deposit amount of customers having accounts opened between dates 1-12-96 and 1-5-97

SELECT actno, amount 
FROM Deposit 
WHERE adate BETWEEN '1996-12-01' AND '1997-05-01';

Query 4: Find the average account balance at the Perryridge branch.

SELECT AVG(amount) AS Average_Balance 
FROM Deposit 
WHERE bname = 'Perryridge';

Query 5: Find the names of all branches where the average account balance is more than $1,200.

SELECT bname 
FROM Deposit 
GROUP BY bname 
HAVING AVG(amount) > 1200;

Query 6: Delete depositors having deposits less than 5000.

DELETE FROM Deposit 
WHERE amount < 5000;

Query 7: Create a view on the Deposit table.

CREATE VIEW Deposit_View AS
SELECT actno, cname, bname, amount, adate 
FROM Deposit;
