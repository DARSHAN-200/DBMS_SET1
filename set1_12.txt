12. Create the following tables. Solve  queries by SQL 
•  Deposit (actno,cname,bname,amount,adate) 
• Branch (bname,city) 
• Customers (cname, city) 
• Borrow(loanno,cname,bname, amount) 
Add primary key and foreign key wherever applicable. 
Insert data into the above created tables. 
Solve following queries by SQL 
1. Display customer name having living city Bombay and branch city Nagpur 
2. Display customer name having same living city as their branch city 
3. Display customer name who are borrowers as well as depositors and having 
living city Nagpur. 
4. Display borrower names having deposit amount greater than 1000 and loan 
amount greater than 2000 
5. Display customer name living in the city where branch of depositor sunil is 
located. 
6. Create an index on deposit table 


Step 1: Creating Tables with Primary and Foreign Keys

-- Creating Branch Table
CREATE TABLE Branch (
    bname VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Creating Customers Table
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    cname VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Creating Deposit Table with Foreign Key References
CREATE TABLE Deposit (
    actno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    cname VARCHAR(50),
    bname VARCHAR(50),
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    adate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (cname) REFERENCES Customers(cname),
    FOREIGN KEY (bname) REFERENCES Branch(bname)
);

-- Creating Borrow Table with Foreign Key References
CREATE TABLE Borrow (
    loanno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    cname VARCHAR(50),
    bname VARCHAR(50),
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (cname) REFERENCES Customers(cname),
    FOREIGN KEY (bname) REFERENCES Branch(bname)
);


Step 2: Inserting Sample Data

-- Inserting Data into Branch Table
INSERT INTO Branch (bname, city) VALUES
('NAGPUR_BRANCH', 'Nagpur'),
('BOMBAY_BRANCH', 'Bombay');

-- Inserting Data into Customers Table
INSERT INTO Customers (cname, city) VALUES
('Anil', 'Bombay'),
('Sunil', 'Nagpur'),
('Alice', 'Nagpur'),
('John', 'Bombay');

-- Inserting Data into Deposit Table
INSERT INTO Deposit (actno, cname, bname, amount, adate) VALUES
(1001, 'Anil', 'BOMBAY_BRANCH', 1500, '2023-03-01'),
(1002, 'Sunil', 'NAGPUR_BRANCH', 2000, '2023-04-01'),
(1003, 'Alice', 'NAGPUR_BRANCH', 3000, '2023-05-01');

-- Inserting Data into Borrow Table
INSERT INTO Borrow (loanno, cname, bname, amount) VALUES
(2001, 'Anil', 'BOMBAY_BRANCH', 2500),
(2002, 'Sunil', 'NAGPUR_BRANCH', 1500),
(2003, 'Alice', 'NAGPUR_BRANCH', 3500);


Step 3: Queries
Query 1: Display customer name living in city Bombay and branch city Nagpur.

SELECT c.cname 
FROM Customers c 
JOIN Deposit d ON c.cname = d.cname
JOIN Branch b ON d.bname = b.bname
WHERE c.city = 'Bombay' AND b.city = 'Nagpur';


Query 2: Display customer name having the same living city as their branch city.

SELECT c.cname 
FROM Customers c 
JOIN Deposit d ON c.cname = d.cname
JOIN Branch b ON d.bname = b.bname
WHERE c.city = b.city;

Query 3: Display customer name who are borrowers as well as depositors and living in city Nagpur.

SELECT DISTINCT c.cname
FROM Customers c
JOIN Deposit d ON c.cname = d.cname
JOIN Borrow b ON c.cname = b.cname
WHERE c.city = 'Nagpur';


Query 4: Display borrower names having deposit amount greater than 1000 and loan amount greater than 2000.

SELECT DISTINCT c.cname
FROM Customers c
JOIN Deposit d ON c.cname = d.cname
JOIN Borrow b ON c.cname = b.cname
WHERE d.amount > 1000 AND b.amount > 2000;


Query 5: Display customer name living in the city where the branch of depositor Sunil is located

SELECT c.cname 
FROM Customers c
JOIN Deposit d ON c.cname = d.cname
JOIN Branch b ON d.bname = b.bname
WHERE b.city = (SELECT br.city FROM Branch br 
                JOIN Deposit de ON br.bname = de.bname 
                WHERE de.cname = 'Sunil');


Query 6: Create an index on the Deposit table.

CREATE INDEX idx_deposit_amount ON Deposit(amount);
